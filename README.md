<p align='left'>I‚Äôm an entry-level tech enthusiast transitioning into software engineering, with a background in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior. Originally, I pursued a career in health, but I‚Äôve since discovered a deep passion for technology and its power to create meaningful impact.

My journey in tech began with a foundation in data analysis, which ignited my love for solving problems through code and visual storytelling. I believe that technology can transform experiences and create meaningful connections. Here‚Äôs a bit more about me:

üìä **Data & Analytics Enthusiast** ‚Äì With experience in business intelligence and data visualization, I transform data into impactful insights to drive informed decisions. I'm familiar with using Python, SQL, R, Tableau, Google Sheets/Excel, PowerBI, but I'm constantly in the process of improving my use and learning more about those tools.

‚ú® **Web Design** ‚Äì When I was a child, I loved writing blogs and designing my blog theme with html and CSS (that was probably the first time I ever came across coding despite not knowing much of it!). During that time, I remember experimenting with colors, decorating borders, changing the image of mouse cursor, and even adding a swf file from the web for extra page effects (such as raining droplets or falling snowflakes). I'm currently diving back into learning more about web development and incorporating JavaScript to add extra level of interactivity! 

üé® **Digital Artist** ‚Äì  I enjoy digital drawing and exploring creative tools like Procreate and Clip Studio Paint, constantly expanding my artistic and technical abilities.

üöÄ **Curious & Always Learning** ‚Äì Constantly adding new tools and techniques to my toolkit, I‚Äôm excited by everything from coding languages to creative software. I‚Äôve practically been a student forever‚Äîhaving completed a major and two minors in college, followed by two years working on two master‚Äôs degrees. Now, I continue my learning journey with online classes on freeCodeCamp, Coursera, and bootcamps, always eager to dive deeper into new topics and skills.

üåè **Embracing Growth & Hard Work** ‚Äì As a first-generation immigrant, my journey has been filled with eye-opening moments, learning from diverse cultures, and embracing the values of resilience and dedication. Inspired by a culture of hard work and collaboration, I carry these principles into everything I do, from coding to creative projects.

I‚Äôm always looking for new ways to tell stories with data, build smooth user interfaces, and elevate my skill set. Let‚Äôs connect! I'm open to collaborations, learning, and sharing knowledge with fellow tech explorers.</p>
