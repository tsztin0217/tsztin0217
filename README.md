I'm a passionate, entry-level tech enthusiast with a knack for digital creativity. My journey began with a foundation in data analysis, which sparked a love for solving problems through code and visual storytelling. Here’s a bit more about me:

📊 Data & Analytics Enthusiast – With experience in business intelligence and data visualization, I transform data into impactful insights to drive informed decisions. I'm familiar with using Python, SQL, R, Tableau, Google Sheets/Excel, PowerBI and are in the process of learning more about them.

🎨 Digital Artist – I love digital drawing and exploring tools that expand my creative abilities, from illustration to animation and beyond. Some of my favorite tools include Procreate and Clip Studio Paint.

🚀 Curious & Always Learning – Constantly adding new tools and techniques to my toolkit, I’m excited by everything from coding languages to creative software.

🌏 First-Generation Immigrant – Originally from Hong Kong, my journey is fueled by resilience and a unique perspective that I bring to my work.

I’m always looking for new ways to tell stories with data, build smooth user interfaces, and elevate my skill set. Let’s connect! I'm open to collaborations, learning, and sharing knowledge with fellow tech explorers.</p>
