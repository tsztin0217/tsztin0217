I'm a passionate, entry-level tech enthusiast with a knack for digital creativity. With a BS in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior, I originally pursued a career in the health field to meet my parents' expectations. However, However, I've discovered that there are countless ways to make a positive impact. 

My journey in tech began with a foundation in data analysis, which ignited my love for solving problems through code and visual storytelling. I believe that technology can transform experiences and create meaningful connections. Here’s a bit more about me:

📊 Data & Analytics Enthusiast – With experience in business intelligence and data visualization, I transform data into impactful insights to drive informed decisions. I'm familiar with using Python, SQL, R, Tableau, Google Sheets/Excel, PowerBI, but I'm constantly in the process of learning more about them.

✨ Web Design – When I was a child, I loved writing blogs and designing my blog theme with html and CSS (that was probably the first time I ever came across coding despite not knowing much of it!). During that time, I remember experimenting with colors, decorating borders, changing the image of mouse cursor, and even adding a swf file from the web for extra page effects (such as raining droplets or falling snowflakes). I'm currently diving back into learning more about web development and incorporating JavaScript to add extra level of interactivity! 

🎨 Digital Artist – I love digital drawing and exploring tools that expand my creative abilities, from illustration to animation and beyond. Some of my favorite tools include Procreate and Clip Studio Paint.

🚀 Curious & Always Learning – Constantly adding new tools and techniques to my toolkit, I’m excited by everything from coding languages to creative software.

🌏 First-Generation Immigrant – Originally from Hong Kong, my journey is fueled by resilience and a unique perspective that I bring to my work.

I’m always looking for new ways to tell stories with data, build smooth user interfaces, and elevate my skill set. Let’s connect! I'm open to collaborations, learning, and sharing knowledge with fellow tech explorers.</p>
